            <h1>Mercury</h1>

            <p>Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800째F (430째C) and at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290째F (-180째C).</p>
            <h2 class="abx2">Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth.
                From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. 
    </p>
          <h2 >Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>Mercury speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, being the fastest than any other planet.
            Mercury completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun, each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again. One Mercury solar day equals 176 Earth days.
            Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and does not experience seasons.
    </p>
    <h2>Moons and Rings</h2>
          <p>Mercury doesn't have moons or rings.
        </p>
          <h2>Formation</h2>
          <p>Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
        </p>
          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p>Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85% of the planet's radius. Mercury's outer shell, comparable to Earth's outer shell, is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.</p>
          <h2>Surface</h2>
          <p>Mercury's surfaceis scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets.
            Very large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid impacts on the planet's surface early in the solar system's history. There are also cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the planet's interior cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.
            Most of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are called "crater rays." They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of rock under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The space environment causes the rays to darken with time.
            Mercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions in permanent shadows.
    </p>
          <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
          <p>Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.
    </p>
          <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
          <p>Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.</p>
