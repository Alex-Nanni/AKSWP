- About: We participated in The largest annual global hackathon! (we reached the final at NASA Space Apps Campinas) and created a solution for the “Planetary Tourism Office” challenge, which is about a distant future where interplanetary travel is common, and the challenge is about creating a means of informing people about these trips and about the planets in the solar system.
- Our Project: To solve this challenge, we created a website with information about travel plans, created images of the planets and spacecraft, and provided information about each planet and the sun.
               
Obs: 
- Maybe it appears as AKSW Space Lines only, that was the old name but there was an mistake when changing the name on the website and perhaps it appears without the P.
- If the page looks a little strange with oval planets and out-of-place text, try disabling adblock and adjusting the zoom of the page to fix it.
