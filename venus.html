            <h1>Venus</h1>

            <p>Venus is the second planet from the. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.
            </p>
    
            <h2 class="abx">Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>The planet is nearly as big around as Earth - 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers) across, versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon.
                Venus is some 38 million miles (about 61 million kilometers) distant. But most of the time the two planets are farther apart.
    </p>
          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>Spending a day on Venus would be quite a disorienting experience. For one thing, your day would be 243 Earth days long. For another, because of the planet's extremely slow rotation, sunrise to sunset would take 117 Earth days. The Sun would rise in the west and set in the east, because Venus spins backward compared to Earth.
    </p>
    <h2>Moons and Rings</h2>
          <p>Venus has no moons or rings.
        </p>
          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p>The planet has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust. 
            NASA`s Magellan spacecraft, which ended a five-year mission to Venus in 1994, mapped the broiling surface using radar. Magellan saw a land of extreme volcanism â€“ a relatively young surface, one recently reshaped (in geologic terms), and chains of towering mountains.</p>
          <h2>Surface</h2>
          <p>Photos snapped from the probes to Venus sent by the Soviet Union between 1961 and 1984 show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape, and a sky that is likely some shade of sulfur yellow.
            Volcanoes and tectonic forces appear to have erased most traces of the early surface of Venus. The average age of surface features could be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.
            Venus has valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes.
    </p>
          <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
          <p>Venus atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself; The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease.
    </p>
          <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
          <p>The planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun's magnetic field and the planet's outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere. The solar wind carries with it the Sun's magnetic field. When the Sun's magnetic field interacts with the electrically excited ionosphere of Venus, it creates or induces, a magnetic field there. This induced magnetic field envelops the planet and is shaped like an extended teardrop, or the tail of a comet, as the solar wind blows past Venus and outward into the solar system.</p>
