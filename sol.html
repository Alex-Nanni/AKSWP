        <h1>Sun</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
The Sun is a pivotal star in our solar system, providing heat, light, and gravitational stability. It powers life on Earth, shapes our climate, and influenced the formation of our solar system's planets and celestial bodies. Understanding the Sun is crucial for understanding our place in the cosmos.

        <h2>Light-Years and Solar Masses</h2>
        <p>
            Distances between objects in space can be huge, so scientists have created new units to help express measurements on an enormous scale. Because all light travels at a constant speed of about 300,000 kilometres per second, it can be used to measure a light-year: the distance that light travels in one Earth year. That's about 9.5 trillion kilometres! The Sun is only about 150 million kilometres, or eight light-minutes, away from Earth.

Because the Sun is our closest and most well-understood star, astronomers use its characteristics as a reference when they study other stars.

        <h2>Orbit and rotation</h2>
        <p>
            The Sun orbits the centre of our galaxy. It takes the Sun about 250 million years to complete one full orbit. Like the planets, it also rotates on its own axis. It takes a little over 25 days for the Sun to complete a full rotation

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The Sun is made up of several layers that each have different characteristics.
Energy from the core is transported outward through two layers called the radiative and convective zones.
The core: Energy from the core is transported outward through two layers called the radiative and convective zones.
The surface of the Sun has a temperature of about 5500 degrees Celsius.
And the corona that can reach a scorching 20 million degrees Celsius. And it is the layer that can be seen during total solar eclipses.

        <h2>Space weather</h2>
        <p>
            The Sun's activity can have a significant impact on our daily lives. Solar storms are often associated with the beautiful aurora, but these events can also be dangerous they can trigger power outages, satellite malfunctions, and even disruptions to GPS and communication systems. The intensity of these storms is sometimes influenced by the Sun's seasons.
